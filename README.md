# Getting Started with Galileo Gen2
This is a small tutorial I made for myself to get this damn thing to start working(especially for accessing the Linux shell of Galileo)
At the time of writing August, 2019, Intel has stopped the production for All the Intel Makers Boards(Edison, Galileo, Curie etc).


If you're using Linux, then use this link [Getting started in Linux](https://github.com/bitwidth/GalileoGen2_getting_started_OnLinux/blob/master/ForLinux.md)
